## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pep8/run_py.png) | Pass: No Errors|
| words.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/words.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pep8/word_list.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| gallows.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/gallows.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pep8/gallows.png) | Pass: No Errors |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse_mobile.png) | Few warnings |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse_desktop.png) | Few warnings |
| Home | Tablet | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse_tablet.png) | Few warnings |

## User Story Testing

| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new site user, I would like to have an option to see instructions or start the game, so that I can choose to see how to play or start right away. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/menu.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to to see a clear error message, so that I can know that I entered the wrong input. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/error_message.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to I would like to see the gallows, so that I can see how many mistakes I've made. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/gallows.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to I would like to see wrong guesses, so that I can know which incorrect letters I have already chosen . | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/wrong_guess.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to see the word fill in when I guess the right letter, so that I can track my progress. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/fill_word.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to I would like to see a win or lose message, so that I know if I guessed the right word or not. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/win_message.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to be able to see an end screen, so that I can choose to play again or check the instructions. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature/end_screen.png) |

## Bugs

- The gallows change colour unexpectidly at the start of game.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/gallows_bug.png)

    - To fix this, I added another `Fore.WHITE` before the gallows.

- Incorrect numbers and characters are listed in wrong guesse.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/wrong_input_bug.png)

    - To fix this, I removed the recursive loop and replaced with an internal while loop.

## Unfixed Bugs

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
