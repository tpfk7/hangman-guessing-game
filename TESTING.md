## Code Validation

### Python

I have used the recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

The CI Python Linter can be used two different ways.
- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click on.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).
    - Examples:

    | File | CI URL | Raw URL | Combined |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | PP3 *run.py* file | `https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/run.py` | https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/run.py |
    | Boutique Ado *settings.py* | `https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/boutique_ado/settings.py` | https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/boutique_ado/settings.py |


| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pep8/run_py.png) | Pass: No Errors|
| words.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/boutique-ado/settings.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pep8/word_list.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| gallows.py | [CI PEP8](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/main/blog/views.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/pep8/gallows.png) | Pass: No Errors |

## Lighthouse Audit

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Size | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | Mobile | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse_mobile.png) | Few warnings |
| Home | Desktop | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse_desktop.png) | Few warnings |
| Home | Tablet | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse_tablet.png) | Few warnings |

## Defensive Programming

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

Flask/Django:
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

Repeat for all other tests, as applicable to your own site.
The aforementioned tests are just an example of a few different project scenarios.

## User Story Testing

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Bugs

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

For JavaScript and Python applications, it's best to screenshot the errors to include them as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

### GitHub **Issues**

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/tpfk7/hangman-guessing-game/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

## Unfixed Bugs

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
